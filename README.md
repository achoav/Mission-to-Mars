# Background
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, I will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

# Deliverables 
This assignment consists of three technical analyses

## Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using your Python and HTML skills, I will add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

## Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
For this part of the Challenge, I will update your web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
